 # travelplans
 
 ## Application screens
 The application is created to plan travel plans. The User can see created travel plans, update them, create new ones. The Admin can work in User mode, or in Admin Mode, where he has access to all users travel plans.
 Admin can also edit the existing travel plans, but as admin has no opportunity to create plan for another user.
